### To help to easier find the accuracy through each attack, here is brief structure for the notebook.

# Task 1 Basic Seting on ResNet34

# Task 2 FSGM - Pixel wise attack

# Task 3 Improved attacks - PGD attack

# Task 4: Patch attacks

# Task 5 Evaluate DenseNet-121 transfer performance

you can using control F to find those text cell to help you quickly find the accuracy result.
